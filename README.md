Solutions for https://github.com/karan/Projects

(Part of them. Excluded the projects which has complexity GUI.)

Numbers
---------

- [x] **Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

- [x] **Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

- [x] **Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

- [x] **Distance Between Two Cities** - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.

- [x] **Complex Number Algebra** - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.

Classic Algorithms
-----------------

- [x] **Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

- [x] **Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

- [x] **Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

- [x] **Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).


Graph
--------

- [x] **Graph from links** - Create a program that will create a graph or network from a series of links.


Data Structures
---------

- [x] **Inverted index** - An [Inverted Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.


Text
---------

- [x] **Fizz Buzz** - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- [x] **Reverse a String** - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

- [x] **Pig Latin** - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

- [x] **Count Vowels** - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

- [x] **Check if Palindrome** - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

- [x] **Count Words in a String** - Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.

- [x] **Vigenere / Vernam / Ceasar Ciphers** - Functions for encrypting and decrypting data messages. Then send them to a friend.


Classes
---------

- [x] **Product Inventory Project** - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an *inventory* class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.
